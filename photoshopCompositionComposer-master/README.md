# photoshopCompositionComposer
This script will create unique compositions out of members contained within the top-level document groups, and save them into a desired location both as a `png`- and a `psd`-file. Tested on Photoshop CC 2015.

## Usage
1. See the Example and the Preview below to learn how it works
2. Download and unzip `photoshopCompositionComposer` `jsx`-file
3. Open your project and navigate to `File > Scripts > Browse...`
4. Browse and load the downloaded `jsx` file

Note: use prefix `__` (double underscore) for top-level group names to exclude groups from the composition composing process. E.g. `__ignoreThisGroup`

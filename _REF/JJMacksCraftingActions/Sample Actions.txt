	Action: Sample Action

The first sample action adds watermarks layers onto an image. The action starts off by using one of my run twice scripts for actions "SaveAndRestoreResolution.jsx" which saves the current document Print DPI and current users ruler units on the first run. The Action then scales all documents to the same print size so it will work on any size document the same way. The action then add watermarks to the Photoshop document each on its own layer. The first watermark is added using the custom shape tool and Photoshop copyright shape, The shape layer is size for the scaled print size. Then the shape layer is centered and styled. A second watermark layer is added using Photoshop menu file>place to add my custom colored logo to the bottom left corner. This section is turn off because my logo PSD file is in my directory "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop Scripts\My Scripts\JJMack8bit.psd" and two fonts are used QuigleWigle and Adobe Caslon PRO which you may not have. The PSD file and QuigleWigle Font file are included if you install these you can turn on that section in the action.  A third watermark is added to the top right of the document using Photoshop's text tool using a font size for the particular size of the document. The text layer is then moved to the bottom right and styled.  The action end using the script SaveAndRestoreResolution.jsx which restores the document original print size and ruler units.

	Action: Add Photo Board and Photo Corners

The second sample action adds Photo Corners to an Image and places a new larger canvas under the image that is filled with the current foreground color.  Its not that easy to do for an action has no idea of the current Photoshop document contents on which its being used. After a little reminder to the user This action starts out using three of my scripts for actions. Like the first example action "SaveAndRestoreResolution.jsx" is used, this is followed by a second run twice script "orient.jsx".  I want to add Photo Corners that have the same size for image that have a portrait or landscape orientation. The orient.jsx script will note the Photoshop document orientation and rotate portrait orientated documents to landscape. A third script "ConvertBackground.jsx" is then used to convert the bottom layer to a normal layer if the bottom layer was a "Photoshop Background" layer.  Normally I do not change a users layer on them however in this case I have no choice, for no layers can be added below a "Photoshop Background" layer. The action then scales the documents print width to 8" so it will work the same way on all size images. The canvas size is expanded slightly to acomidate the Photo corners and a four photo corners layer is built, named “4 Corners” and has a layer style added to it.  The action continues adding a new layer naming it “PhotoBoard”, which it adds a layer style to and  then it moves the layer the bottom of the layers stack. The action adds canvas to add size to the “PhotoBoard” layer and fills the “PhotoBoard” layer with the foreground color. A "color balance" layer is clipped to the “PhotoBoard” layer to make it easy for the user to tweak its color. The two run twice scripts are then used again to restore the image's original print size orientation and ruler units.  While the image will print its original size the actual print size will be larger, the be the size of the “PhotoBoard” layer which is sized for the original images sizes.  The action ends with a reminder to the user as to how they can tweak the 4 Corners” layer.
